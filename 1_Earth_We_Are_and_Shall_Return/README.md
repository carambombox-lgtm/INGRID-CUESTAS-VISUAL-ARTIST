**Medium / Format:** Multidisciplinary (performance, culinary ritual, installation, video)  
**Location / Context:** Colombia / Independent Artistic Research

## Description
*Earth We Are and Shall Return* is an immersive artistic project exploring the cyclical nature of existence, ancestry, transformation, and the intimate relationship between the human body and the Earth. Through ritualistic culinary actions, performative gestures, and sensory installations, the project investigates how materials, bodies, and landscapes participate in processes of regeneration and return.

## Relevance to the Fellowship Group
This project highlights Ingrid’s artistic research practice, centered on materiality, transformation, and the connection between human experience and organic processes. It demonstrates her interest in multisensory methodologies, expanded performance, and ecological narratives—elements directly relevant to faculty groups focusing on art & science, post-natural ecologies, material research, and embodied knowledge.

**ZAG** is a nomadic, experimental, and autonomous public intervention project. It starts with a DIWO process to build the pirate mobile kitchen, a portable and creative laboratory with a basic pop up kitchen structure, designed to develop multidisciplinary artistic urban interventions by collective work and collaborative processes that experiment around culinary as the society's principal meeting point, an artistic language capable of provoking every human sense, a political node, and an analog network. 

It was created with a foldable and removable system to be constructed in a collective, collaborative, and multidisciplinary DIWO process. The project developed four volumes in four different cities around South America: La Paz, Bolivia; São Paulo, Brazil; Medellín, Colombia; and Bogotá, Colombia.

## Concept

ZAG is conceived as an **autonomous gastrosophical zone**—a temporary kitchen-laboratory that appears unexpectedly in streets, parks, markets, art, and cultural events.  
It challenges the boundaries between:

- cooking and contemporary art 
- nourishment and storytelling  
- piracy and autonomy  
- public rituals and spontaneous gatherings  

ZAG occupies space like a small, friendly rebellion: a pop-up territory where eating becomes an artistic act.

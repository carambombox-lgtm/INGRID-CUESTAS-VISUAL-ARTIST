## ZAG — Autonomous Gastrosophical Zone
### *Pirate Mobile Kitchen*

**ZAG** is a nomadic, experimental, and autonomous kitchen-performance project designed to intervene in public space through food, hospitality, and collective imagination.

This “pirate kitchen” operates at the intersection of **gastrosofía**, **artistic activism**, and **situated performance**, transforming everyday ingredients into radical gestures of community, resistance, and poetic nourishment.

---

## Concept

ZAG is conceived as a **mobile gastrosophical zone**—a temporary kitchen-laboratory that appears unexpectedly in streets, parks, markets, and cultural events.  
It challenges the boundaries between:

- cooking and performance  
- nourishment and storytelling  
- piracy and autonomy  
- public rituals and spontaneous gatherings  

ZAG occupies space like a small, friendly rebellion: a pop-up territory where eating becomes an artistic act.

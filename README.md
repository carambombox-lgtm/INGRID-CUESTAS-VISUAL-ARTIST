🌿 ABOUT THE ARTIST — INGRID CUESTAS

Colombian interdisciplinary visual artist working across art, science, technology, and alchemy, using different languages as expanded drawing, edible biopolymers, multimedia installation, sensory experiences, video-art, and speculative futures.

My practice moves between the micro and the cosmic, weaving together:

Material ecology

Ancestral and botanical knowledge

Food and bio-based materials

Cosmology and symbolic systems

Collective intelligence

Art–science experimentation

Sustainability and post-natural ecologies

My central question is:
How does matter reveal its intelligence through transformation?

🌱 PROJECT 01 — THE TREE OF LIFE
A cosmology of materials, ecologies, and ancestral memory

The Tree of Life functions as a conceptual and material framework where each branch represents a sphere of knowledge:

Roots — Earth, Land, Ancestry

Trunk — Material Intelligence, Entelia Biopolymer

Branches — Ecology, Sensors, AI Observation

Leaves — Video-Art, Data, Microscopy, Timelapse

Crown — Philosophy, Mythology, Cosmology

This structure mirrors the living intelligence of the edible biopolymer and its relationship with environmental forces.

🍃 ENTELIA — MATERIAL INTELLIGENCE BRANCH

Entelia is the material heart of The Tree of Life:
an edible, biodegradable, biocompostable biopolymer created from renewable, food-safe ingredients.

It is developed as:

A living material

A nutritive membrane

A cosmic–botanical map

A speculative ecological body

A sensorial and scientific object

Research includes:

Base formulas and botanical variants (hibiscus, basil, spinach, spirulina, etc.)

Quantum and thermodynamic behavior

Degradation in earth, freshwater, and seawater

Interaction with microorganisms, fauna, flora

Sensory, color and texture changes over time

Microscopy and time-lapse documentation

Expanded drawing, diagramming, and symbolism

🌊 THE THREE ECOLOGICAL MINI-LABS

These mobile laboratories test the biopolymer’s behavior across real environments.

1. Sea Lab — Floating Oxum Bubble

Biopolymer sphere holding micro-sensors

Underwater and surface cameras

Salinity + movement + fauna interaction analysis

2. Waterfall Lab — Freshwater Oxum Bubble

Timelapse observation of membrane behavior

Turbulence, oxygenation, and degradation

3. Earth Lab — Hanging Structure

Zenithal camera filming a biopolymer film on soil

Microorganisms, insects, humidity, temperature data

These labs are also video-art ecosystems, generating imagery for visual essays and archival documentation.

🎥 VIDEO ART & TIME-BASED DOCUMENTATION

These works form the audiovisual branch of the Tree of Life.

EARTH WE ARE AND SHALL RETURN

Metaverse installation + biopolymer cosmology
→ https://youtu.be/HjLLQljQpGk

An expanded digital archaeology of edible biopolymers, exploring sustainable futures and ODS-aligned imaginaries.
Created with illustrations, 3D objects, textures, sound, and symbolic cosmology.
Winner of the Fraunhofer ISI Open Call (UNESCO Karlsruhe).

SOL DE NOCHE

Microscopic timelapse of bioprocesses
→ https://youtu.be/XhJcwrUo1GQ

Video-art from a DIWO (Do It With Others) laboratory exploring food systems, fermentation, material behavior, and microscopic ecologies.
Shows the intimate transformation of living matter.

MEAT DOES NOT COME ON A TRAY

Ethics, materiality, and food systems
→ https://youtu.be/ziGNHlRZBPY

A critical audiovisual reflection on consumption, visibility, and ethical materiality.

🌌 COSMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY

My research integrates:

Micro ↔ Macro

Botany ↔ Mythology

Ancestral knowledge ↔ Material science

Ritual ecology ↔ Technology

The intelligence of matter ↔ The intelligence of nature

Water, soil, plants, and biodegradable membranes become portals into a deeper understanding of life’s interconnected systems.

🧭 RESEARCH QUESTIONS

How does an edible biopolymer respond to environmental forces across different ecosystems?

How can sensors and AI help reveal the hidden intelligence of materials?

Can a biodegradable membrane function as a speculative organism?

How can video art become a scientific record and a poetic document at the same time?

What does degradation teach us about reciprocity, continuity, and transmutation?

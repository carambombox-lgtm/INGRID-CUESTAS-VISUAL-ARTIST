# Sol de Noche Matadero Medialab Residency

**Years:** [2019 - 2020]  
**Medium / Format:** Multidisciplinary (creative laboratory, installation, audiovisual, collaborative)  
**Location / Context:** [Madrid, Spain]

## Description
*Sol de Noche* was my immersive artistic residency project focused on experimental work, DIWO (do it with others), and citizen participation. The project explores themes of food sovereignty, agroecology, urban ecology, circular economy, and sensory perception through interdisciplinary collaboration, laboratory experimentation, and FabLab prototyping. The work investigates how communities can create solutions for the daily footprint of the consumption chain.

## Relevance to the Fellowship Group
This project demonstrates Ingrid’s commitment to experimental research, participatory methodologies, and the fusion of art and technology. It aligns with faculty interests in expanded performance, immersive installations, and art that interacts with ecological and urban contexts.

# Sol de Noche — Matadero Medialab Residency

[![Sol de Noche Banner](./SOL_DE_NOCHEBANNER.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XhJcwrUo1GQ?si=rHNHfzppoVAakldl)

**Years:** 2019 – 2020  
**Medium / Format:** Multidisciplinary — creative laboratory, installation, audiovisual, collaborative  
**Location / Context:** Madrid, Spain


Sol de Noche emerged from my inquiry into how art can contribute to buen vivir through relational, political, and multidisciplinary practices. Anchored in a maker spirit, collaborative work, and my gastrosophical manifesto, the project positions the kitchen as a site of encounter, an artistic language capable of transforming the senses, and a nucleus of political action within an ecology of care.

The residency unfolded as a collective laboratory for researching and prototyping sustainable food systems and edible biomaterials. Participants co-created knowledge, tools, and prototypes that address food sovereignty and environmental crises. All outcomes were developed under a philosophy of open knowledge and citizen-led innovation.

Concept

Over four weeks, the laboratory developed two main phases and six research/creation nuclei, weaving artistic experimentation with hands-on food and biomaterial design.

Activities included:

Collaborative research and design sessions

Experimental workshops at MediaLab Prado’s fablab and biolab

Prototyping an edible biopolymer, a DIY food dehydrator, and biodegradable packaging

Public presentations, pitches, and a multimedia mini-installation

Eleven participants — visual artists, designers, cooks, scientists, and programmers — became active agents in producing ludic knowledge through aesthetic language, imagining new ways to approach food sovereignty and sustainability.

Methodology

Collective creation and horizontal learning

Experimental work with organic, local, and seasonal ingredients

Low-tech prototyping with biomaterials

Cross-pollination between art, design, culinary research, and science

Documentation through photography, DIY manuals, and microscopic timelapses

Commitment to open-source culture and accessible citizen innovation

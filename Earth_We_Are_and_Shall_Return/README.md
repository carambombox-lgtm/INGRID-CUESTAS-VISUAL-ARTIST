## About the Project

Digital Media Artwork about the creative process of the artist’s edible biopolymers, presented as an archaeology of the future that collects the vestiges of efforts set on the current and historical moment, focused on the development of daily solutions in communion with various of the 2030 SDGs, drawing a possible sustainable landscape.

Having an apothecary as the main character of the installation, the laboratory is used as a metaphor for a space of knowledge and creation, provoking reflection about the urgency of taking advantage of our current level of technological and scientific development to put it at the service of healing the planet.

# Artistic Research

This folder presents a selection of my artistic research projects that intersect food, ecology, ritual, and experimental media. These works are especially relevant to the group I am applying to, as they explore materiality, collective experience, and more-than-human perspectives through both practice and theory.

## How to read this folder

- Each subfolder corresponds to one project.
- Inside each, you will find:
  - A short conceptual introduction
  - Documentation (images, links, or video stills)
  - Notes on process and methodology
  - Reflections on how the project relates to artistic research

## Projects included

1. **Earth We Are and Shall Return**  
   A performative and culinary project that works with soil, edible matter, and ritual gestures around death, rebirth, and planetary cycles. The piece combines cooking, collective eating, and symbolic actions to question how we relate to Earth as a living body.

2. **Sol de Noche – Matadero Medialab Residency**  
   Research developed during my residency at Matadero Medialab, where I explored light, darkness, urban ecologies, and collective imaginaries. This project combines installation, performative situations, and experimental documentation to investigate how communities inhabit and reimagine nocturnal space.

3. **ZAG**  
   An ongoing artistic research project that explores [here add 1–2 lines about the core of ZAG: e.g. interfaces, sound, bodies, AI, data, territory, etc.]. ZAG functions as a laboratory for testing methods, concepts, and collaborative dynamics that feed into my larger practice.
